# Hi! I'm Raju,

<div class="row">
<div class="col-8">

I am a Research Fellow at Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU), Ã…s, Norway. I am passionate about the analysis and visualizations of data and information. My research and work interest lies in the intersection of statistics, web and programming.

I am from Nepal and currently I am living in Norway with my wife and a kid. I am working on my PhD thesis. It is about the comparative analysis of multivariate methods in statistics. We are using simulated and real data to compare these methods. The data are simulated using a tool called [`simrel`](http://simulatr.github.io/simrel). This is an R package and is in process to get released.
