As a postdoctoral fellow, I am currently working on _trend in melanoma tumour thickness and prognostic factors in Norway_ at Biostatistics Department of University of Oslo. Communicating complex scientific problems and their solutions in a easy to understand language through visualization and illustration has alwyas been my passion. Thus, my research interest lies in the intersection of statistics, data visualization, web and programming.

I live in Drammen, a beautiful city in Norway, with my wife and a son. I spend my personal time mostly cycling, hiking and taking pictures. I also like listing music and sometimes, when I have time, binge watching movies and serial.
