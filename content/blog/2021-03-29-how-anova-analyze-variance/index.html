<p>Often we Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to analyze the variances to find if
different cases results in similar outcome and if the difference is significant.
Following are some simple examples,</p>
<ul>
<li>The effect of different diets on growth of fishes</li>
<li>Comparing the height of three different species of a plant</li>
<li>Type of flour used for baking a bread</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some common examples where in some cases data are collected by setting
up an experiment and in other cases they are collected through sampling.
This article tries to explain how the ANOVA analyze the variance and in what
situation are they significant throught both simulated and real data.</p>
<p>Consider the following model with <span class="math inline">\(i=3\)</span> groups and <span class="math inline">\(j=n\)</span> observations,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \varepsilon_{ij}, \; i = 1, 2, 3
\texttt{ and } j = 1, 2, \ldots n\]</span></p>
<p>here, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_i\)</span> is the effect corresponding to group <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ij} \sim \mathrm{N}(0, \sigma^2)\)</span>, the usual assumption of
linear model. In order to understand how ANOVA finds the differences between
groups and how the group mean and their standard deviation influence the
results from ANOVA, let us consider following four cases:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Case 1</dt>
<dd>
Similar group means with high variation within the groups
</dd>
<dt>Case 2</dt>
<dd>
Similar group means with low variation within the groups
</dd>
<dt>Case 3</dt>
<dd>
Distant group means with high variation within the groups
</dd>
<dt>Case 4</dt>
<dd>
Distant group means with low variation within the groups
</dd>
