```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = NA
)
```

R can do data analysis and it can create beautiful reports. You can build all these documents directly in R using `rmarkdown` which is powered by powerful `pandoc`. In lots of occasions, user just wants to get some output format of tables that we can use in other platform such as Microsoft word, LaTeX, HTML or Markdown. Here I will discuss about some packages that helps us doing so including `xtable`, `pander`, `knitr`, `stargazer` and `tables`. I will use a sample dataset and a summary output from a linear model fit and convert them into various format. Although each of them need their own elaborate discussion, I will just use very basics of them since one can always go and dig into the help file for any details.

## Creating Tables {.tabset}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mtcars <- head(mtcars, 5)
```

### xtable {.tab}

```{r, results='asis'}
xtable::print.xtable(
  xtable::xtable(mtcars), type = 'html'
)
```

### pander {.tab}
```{r}
pander::pander(mtcars)
```

### knitr {.tab}
```{r}
knitr::kable(mtcars)
```


### tables {.tab}
```{r}
tables::as.tabular(mtcars)
```


## Exercise

  1. Use the `mtcars` dataset, fit a linear model with `mpg` as response variable and `wt`,`hp` and `disp` as predictor variable. Generate a LaTeX table and HTML table for the fitted model using xtable.
