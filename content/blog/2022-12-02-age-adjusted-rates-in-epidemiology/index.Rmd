In general, rates means how fast something is changing usually over time. In
epidemiology uses it to describe how quickly a disese occurs in a population.
For example, 35 cases of melanoma cases in 100,000 person per year convey a the
sense of speed of spread of disease in that population. Incidence rate and 
mortality rate are two examples that we will discuss further below.

> In epidemiology, rate measures the frequency of occurance of an event in a

Let us use melanoma as a outcome in the following discussion. Here, we can 
calculate a crude incidence rate as,

$$\mathcal{R} = \frac{\textsf{no. of melanoma cases}}{\textsf{no. of person-year}} \times \textsf{some multiplier}$$

In the case of mortality rate, we can replace the numerator of above expression
by the number of melanoma deaths.

## Age-specific rate

Weather to understand a broder prespecitve or to compare across population, these
rates are often analyzed stratified by sex and age. This also helps to remove 
the confounding effection of these factors. The incidence/mortality rate
per age-group is usually referred to as _Age-specific rates_ where rates
are computed for each age-groups. This is often desirable since factor `age` 
has a strong effect on mortality and incidence of most disease especially the 
cronic one.

## Age-adjusted rate

Many research articles, however presents the age-adjusted rates. Age-adjusted 
rates are standardized (weighted) using some standard population age-structure. 
For example, many european studies on melanoma uses european standard age
distribution. While any reasonal studies have also used world standard population.
Cancer registry in their reports sometimes uses age-structure of that country in
some given year. For instance, Norway[^3] and Finland[^4] have used the their population in 
2014 as standard population in their recent cancer report while Australia have
used 2001 Australian population[^5].

Standardized (adjusted) rates makes comparison between the population possible.
Figure \@ref(fig:age-std) shows the difference in the age distribution between
world population and European population. Following table are some of the
standard population often used in the study. Further on standard popuation see 
[`seer.cancer.gov`](https://seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/stdpop.19ages.html)[^6].

## Calculating age-standardized rate

The age-standardized rate (ASR) is calculated as,

$$\text{Age.Std. Rate} = \frac{\sum_i\mathcal{R}_i\mathcal{w}_i}{\sum_i\mathcal{w}_i}$$

where, $\mathcal{w}_i$ is the weight corresponding to $i^\text{th}$ age-group in the 
reference population.

Let's explore further with an example from melanoma cases from Australia.

## Example

The following example have used the Austrailian cancer data with 5-year 
age-group[^2] after filtering melanoma cases from 1982 to 2018. The dataset has
yearly count and age-specific incidence rate of melanoma for men and women.

Let us use the above European standard population to find the yearly
age-standardized incidence by sex.

```{r}
data <- fread("melanoma.csv")
std_pop <- popEpi::stdpop18
```
```{r}
data[AgeGroup %in% c("85-89", "90+"), AgeGroup := "85+"]
setnames(std_pop, c("AgeGroup", "World", "Europe", "Nordic"))
std_pop[AgeGroup == "85", AgeGroup := "85+"]
std_pop[, c(2:4) := lapply(.SD, prop.table), .SDcols = 2:4]
asp_data <- merge.data.table(data, std_pop[, .(AgeGroup, World)], by = "AgeGroup")
asp <- asp_data[, .(AgeAdjRate = sum(ASR * World)), by = .(Year, Sex)]
```
```{r}
asp[, tail(.SD, 8), by = Sex] %>%
    dcast.data.table(
        formula = Sex ~ Year,
        value.var = "AgeAdjRate") %>% 
        kableExtra::kbl(caption = paste(
            "Age-standardized incidence rate of melanoma",
            "Australia from 2011 to 2018"
    )) %>% 
    kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

Now, let us compare the age-specific rates (crude rates) and  age-standardized
rates with a plot,

## Discussion

Figure \@fig(rate-plot) shows that the incidence of melanoma has larger 
difference in men between the age-groups than in women and men also have a sharp 
increase in older age group. In addition, the Figure \@fig(adj-rate-plot) shows that males have higher
age-adjusted incidence of melanoma than women in Australia and this trend is 
increasing over time with rapid increase before 1983 before a drop.

Age-adjusted rates are useful for comparing rates between population but it
cannot give the interpretation required for comparing within a population or
over a time period in that population. This is one of the reason, cancer registry
uses the internal (population structure of their own population) to compute the
age-adjusted rates.
