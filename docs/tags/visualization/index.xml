      <description>Lets scatter into some points created by data in xy-space. Data are scattered everywhere but what relation is there between some specific variable with other. Cutting down to simple talking and stick to the heading, we can use mtcars dataset in R.
The dataset from Motor Trend US magazine, 1974 comprises fuel consumption and 10 various aspects of automobile design and their performance for 32 automobiles of different models. I will try to obtain the scatter plot for the model and the fitted line for the model.</description>

      <description>In many situations, it becomes essential to have a plot with multiple categories. For example, colour the scatter plot according to gender and have two different regression line for each of them.
Lets scatter the some points using data from mtcars, available default in R. Continuing the discussing from this post, where we had plotted mile per gallon (mpg) vs displacement (disp). Here we will create a separate regression line and colour the points accordingly based on number of cylinder (cyl) in the cars.</description>
