      <description>When I was working on my Masters thesis, I needed the latex autocompletion feature in Rsudio, but could not find it anywhere. There is no option to create custom snippet either. But recently I found some basic and necessary auto-completion for latex is available in RStudio. Following are some of the these you want to use, but remember to press Shift + Tab for autocomplete. Further this will only work on sweave or knitr file only, which is pretty obvious.</description>
