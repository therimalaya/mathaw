      <description>Array and matrix/tables are data structures in R with same data types such as numeric, string or boolean. This examples show how to convert a list of vector/matrix/array into a multi-dimentional array so that it will become easier to aggregate them in particular dimension. We can also do this converting everything into data frame but this way can be useful sometimes and is worth learning.
Let us use a dataset already available in R and convert that into a list of tables or matrix.</description>

      <description>Most of the time we need data either for teaching purpose or learning things. Whatever be the reason, data are really important things. R and different packages of R contains different datasets which we can use directly just by installing them. Many books related to R illustrate there examples using these data sources. We can find the dataset from differnt sources as data()
The datasets from the package datasets and other loaded packages is shown in default.</description>
