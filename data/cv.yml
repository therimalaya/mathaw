                          Working closely with students and preparing exercises for the course 
                          helped me not only to understand and solve students’ problems but also 
                          gave me ideas on how to construct lectures, exercises and other activities 
                          for future courses. The experience has also helped me to clearly 
                          understand many basic statistical concepts.
