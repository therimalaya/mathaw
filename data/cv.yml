        Working closely with students and preparing exercises for the course 
        helped me not only to understand and solve students’ problems but also 
        gave me ideas on how to construct lectures, exercises and other activities 
        for future courses. The experience has also helped me to clearly 
        understand many basic statistical concepts.
